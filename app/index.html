                            A new breed of “platformized” wellbeing vendors has emerged, and these providers are giving employees and employers a new, integrated set of offerings to consume.

                        <p>
                            A benefit of a solution like this is the fact that Gympass is really a network, not a discount card. If you’re a New York City investment banker and you’re on the road in London, for example, chances are there’s a gym covered by your program so you can go whenever you want. 
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Customers and users get a guaranteed spot at a gym with a full pass or full access to the apps, fully equal to any other member. Employers get to offer a very high value benefit that is both useful and productive for work. And for HR teams, this radically simplifies the wellbeing offerings, making programs easier to deploy, manage, and measure.
